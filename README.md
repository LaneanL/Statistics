"Globally, women control fewer economic resources than men, including land, financial assets, and employment, leading to differences in their development outcomes. Poor quality gender data translates into poor gender policies. Reliable and complete data on how economic realities for men and women differ and what social factors influence these differences is essential for designing effective policies necessary for development progress. But too often, data gaps inhibit progress on crucial development issues." --World Bank
